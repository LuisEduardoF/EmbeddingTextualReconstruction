# Analysis of Textual Reconstruction Risks in Labor Conciliation Prediction Models

## 📋 Overview

This project investigates security vulnerabilities in Artificial Intelligence systems applied to the Brazilian Judiciary, specifically analyzing the risks of **embedding inversion** in labor conciliation prediction models based on BERT.

## 🎯 Problem and Motivation

The Brazilian Judiciary has adopted Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, using models such as BERTimbau for the analysis of labor lawsuits. Although vector representations (embeddings) are often considered "safe" because they are numerical, this work investigates whether these vectors retain sufficient semantic information to allow:

- **Reconstruction of the original text** from the embeddings
- **Inference of sensitive attributes** through inversion attacks
- **Leakage of confidential information** during the inference phase

## 🎓 Objectives

### General Objective

To experimentally evaluate the security of embeddings generated by the fine-tuned BERTimbau model, verifying the feasibility of recovering textual information from judicial processes using only their vector representations.

Expected Products

1. **Attacker Model**: Neural decoder trained to reverse embeddings in text
2. **Audit Report**: Quantification of the success rate in recovering sensitive tokens and keywords
3. **Risk Analysis**: Assessment of the sufficiency of prior anonymization and dangerous semantic correlations

Methodology

Type of Work

**Experimental Development / Prototype**

This work leverages the technical pipeline already developed in my Master's Thesis, adding an adversarial layer for practical validation of security risks.

### Attack Pipeline

```
Original Text → BERTimbau → Embedding [CLS] → Attacking Model → Reconstructed Text

(Fine-tuned) (Inverter)
```

## 📊 Project Activities

### 1. Embedding Generation
- Use of existing preprocessing pipeline
- Extraction of embeddings from the `[CLS]` token using fine-tuned BERTimbau
- Creation of an intermediate dataset: `(Embedding Vector) → (Original Text)`

### 2. Development of the Adversary Model
- Implementation of an "attacking" neural network
- Architecture designed for textual reconstruction from embeddings
- Prediction of sensitive terms (e.g., names of litigants, occupational diseases)

### 3. Execution of the Inversion Attack
- Training of the adversary model
- Use of Consistent time division with the original project

- Data leak simulation under realistic conditions

### 4. Vulnerability Analysis
- Comparison between reconstructed and original text
- Calculation of information leak metrics
- Quantitative evaluation of attack effectiveness

### 5. Consolidation and Documentation
- Final report connecting results to the concepts of confidentiality and privacy in AI
- Security recommendations for judicial systems
